Python programming using simple statements and expressions.

a.	Write a program to enter two integers and then perform all arithmetic operations on them
b.	Write a program to enter two floating point numbers and then perform all arithmetic operations on them
c.	Write a python program to perform string concatenation, Identify the variant forms of python code to concatenate strings.
d.	Write a python program to demonstrate printing a string within single, double and triple quotes.
e.	Write a python program to print the ascii value of a character.
f.	Write a python program to read a character in uppercase and then print it in lower case.
g.	Write a python program to swap two numbers using a temporary variable.
h.	Write a python program to demonstrate implicit conversion.
i.	Write a python program to demonstrate explicit conversion.
j.	Write a program that reads the address of a user. Display the result by breaking it in multiple lines.
k.	Write a python program to read two floating point numbers. Add these numbers and assign the result to an integer.
l.	Write a python program to calculate simple interest and compound interest.
m.	Write a python program that prompts the user to enter two integers x and y. The program then calculates and displays xy.
n.	Write a python program that prompts user to enter his first name and last name and then displays a message “Greetings!!!Firstname Lastname”.
o.	Write a program to calculate salary of an employee given his basic pay (to be entered by the user), HRA = 10% of basic pay, TA = 5% of basic pay. Define HRA and TA as constants and use them to calculate the salary of the employee.
p.	Write a program to prepare a grocery bill, enter the name of the items purchased, quantity in which it is purchased, and its price per unit. Display the bill in the following format.
***************************BILL*************************
Item Names			Item Quantity		Item Price
Biscuits				6				120
*********************************************************Total Amount to be paid
*********************************************************
q.	Momentum is calculated as e=mc2, m is the mass of the object, v is the velocity. Write a python program that accepts an object’s mass in kg(kilograms) and velocity in meters per second and display its momentum.
r.	Write a program that calculates the number of seconds in a day.
s.	Write a program that prompts the user to enter the first name and his last name. Then display the following message
Hello first name last name
