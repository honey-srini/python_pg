16.	Python program to find factorial of a number
17.	Write a program to convert an integer into the corresponding floating point number.
18.	Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.
19.	A video library rents new videos for Rs.75 a day, and old movies for Rs.50 a day. 
	Write a program to calculate the total charge for a customer's video rentals. 
	The program should prompt the user for the number of each type of video and output the total cost.
20.	Momentum is calculated as e = mc2, where m is the mass of the object and c is its velocity. 
	Write a program that accepts an object's mass and and velocity and displays its momentum.
21.	Write a program that prompts user to enter numbers. 
	The process will repeat until user enters -1. 
	Finally, the program prints the count of even and odd numbers entered.

22.	Write a program that prints numbers from 20 to 1 ( counts downwards).
23.	Evaluate the following arithmetic expressions using the rules of operator precedence in Python.
a.	20//4*2
b.	50%7
c.	-(100/6)+5

24.	Write a program that displays all the numbers from 1-100 that are not divisible by 2 as well as by 4.
